# Nitro Autotuning Framework

Copyright 2012-2015 University of Utah

## Introduction:

Nitro is a programmer-directed code variant tuning framework,
jointly developed by the [University of Utah](http://www.cs.utah.edu) and [NVIDIA Research](http://research.nvidia.com). 
It utilizes machine learning-based classification to automatically
find the best implementation (variant) of a computation for a given input.
It provides C++ and Python interfaces for programmers to specify variants, input dataset features, and constraints.

Nitro consists of two parts:

* Header-only C++ Template Library
* Python-based Autotuning Interface
